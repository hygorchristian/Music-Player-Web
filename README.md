## :speech_balloon: About this Project

The idea of the App is:
_"Reproduce some features of the Spotify App, providing a simple way to implement the existing layouts"._

**PS:** The Spotify was just the context chosen by me for this project, but all the code inside this app can be reused for any app that has audio-streaming as domain, so you can reuse everything here in your next music-player, podcast-library or anything inside this context!

## :thinking: Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

## :mag_right: Some Observations about this App

1 - There's no functionality of the menu items, the buttons are only for UI matters.

## :rocket: Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project in the development mode, you'll need to have a basic environment to run a React JS App, that can be found [here](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
The server with some sample musics run in Firebase, so you can just change the Firebase setup and run your own Firebase project.
